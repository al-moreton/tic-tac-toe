# Tic-tac-toe

[Live version](https://al-moreton.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)

## How it's made?
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

First time using factory functions and IIFEs (Immediately invoked function expression) to avoid having to use the `new` keyword to build objects. Closures have also been used a lot, making use of scope. I've also made an effort to reduce the number of global variables to clean up the code.

Still a bit unsure of the advantage of using Factory Functions over object constructors, especially considering the ability to add a function to the object prototype, which reduces the overall number of functions assigned to memory if a large amount of objects are built.

## Optimisation and improvements
Stuck to the task at hand here, not much else needed.

## Things I would like to add
- Better styling for game
- Name selection and marker choice form presented first without the board
